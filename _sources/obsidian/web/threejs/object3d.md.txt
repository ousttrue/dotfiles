# THREE.Object3D

> Object3D.matrix is automatically computed based on Object3D.position, Object3D.rotation and Object3D.scale. You can disable this by setting Object3D.matrixAutoUpdate 44 to false.
> BTW: Object3D.applyMatrix4() multiplies the given matrix with the existing local one. This is something different than just setting a new matrix. In any event, Object3D.applyMatrix4() also updates Object3D.position, Object3D.rotation and Object3D.scale.
