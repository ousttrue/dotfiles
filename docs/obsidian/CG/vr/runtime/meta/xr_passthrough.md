開発用の機能だよ

> **Note:** Passthrough over Meta Quest Link is a developer-only feature aimed at increasing your development speed by previewing your passthrough-enabled apps while still in development. That being said, the visual appearance and performance characteristics of the experience are slightly different between running over Meta Quest Link and running on an Meta Quest device.
